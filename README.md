# Configuration

An actual full-featured GUI is currently in development.
In the meantime you can swap out different models/shaders using the <strong>Ionic.CFG</strong> file.

Simply set the <strong>Model</strong> path to the place where your OBJ file is located.
FBX support is halfway there so you might even use that.

# Controls

Again, custom controls will be avaiable in the future, for now here is what you can do

<strong>[W, A, S, D]: </strong> Move the camera around.

<strong>[Arrow Keys]: </strong> Move the light around.

<strong>Mouse Click and Drag: </strong> Look around the 3D Scene.

<strong>1: </strong> Draw wireframe

<strong>2: </strong> Draw normal

<strong>R: </strong> Make the light Red.

<strong>G: </strong> Make the light Green.

<strong>B: </strong> Make the light Blue.

<strong>L: </strong> Reset light color.
