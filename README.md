# Configuration

An actual full-featured GUI is currently in development.
In the meantime you can swap out different models/shaders using the <strong>Ionic.CFG</strong> file.

Simply set the <strong>Model</strong> path to the place where your OBJ file is located.
FBX support is halfway there so you might even use that.
